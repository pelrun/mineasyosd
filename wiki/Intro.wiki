minEASYOSD runs on the cheap MinimOSD hardware and realizes an OSD using a GPS.

This project is GNU GPL v3 and using it is at your own risk.

It's based on my other OSD project for NAZA, the minNAZAOSD: http://code.google.com/p/minnazaosd/

and on the ArduCamOSD code: http://code.google.com/p/arducam-osd/
